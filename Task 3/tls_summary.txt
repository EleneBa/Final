TLS SUMMARY

Website tested:
    www.google.com:443

TLS Version:
    TLSv1.3

Cipher Suite:
    TLS_AES_256_GCM_SHA384

Certificate Chain (Root → Intermediate → Leaf):

  Leaf Certificate:
    Subject: CN=www.google.com
    Issuer:  CN=WE2

  Intermediate:
    Subject: CN=WE2
    Issuer:  CN=GTS Root R4

  Root:
    Subject: CN=GTS Root R4
    Issuer:  CN=GlobalSign Root CA

Wireshark Analysis:
    • Client Hello: Contains supported TLS versions, cipher suites, SNI, many extensions.
    • Server Certificate: Server sends the certificate chain shown above.
    • Key Exchange:
        In TLS 1.3, key exchange happens during/after Server Hello.
        Google’s server negotiated X25519MLKEM768 (hybrid key exchange).

Confidentiality:
    TLS encrypts all application data with symmetric encryption
    (AES-GCM in this session). Only parties with the session keys can
    decrypt the traffic.

Integrity:
    TLS uses AEAD ciphers such as AES-GCM which provide authentication
    tags. Any modification of encrypted TLS data causes decryption to
    fail, preventing tampering.

Summary:
    TLS uses certificates for authentication, ECDHE/X25519 for secure
    key exchange, and strong AEAD ciphers to protect confidentiality
    and integrity.
